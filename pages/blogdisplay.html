        <p> <strong>Modern technology <br> in our daily life. <br>
             </strong> <i>Sept 04</i><br><br><br>            
             Modern technology has paved the way for multi-functional devices like the smartwatch and 
            the smartphone. Computers are increasingly faster, more portable, and higher-powered than 
            ever before. With all of these revolutions, technology has also made our lives easier, faster, better, and more fun.</p>

        <p>Technology has also given us brand new devices in recent decades, like smartwatches, tablets, and voice assistant devices. With these devices, we can do things like transfer money instantly and 
            make purchases for everything from clothes, food delivery, groceries, furniture, and more. 
            Technology has changed how we entertain ourselves, meet each other, and consume all types 
            of media. It’s made fun advancements, but it’s also made important advancements in safety 
            when it comes to home security and medical devices.
            <br> <br> technology has changed
            what people term as “media.” The influence of new technology on media is apparent 
            since a media company isn’t necessarily a news platform anymore. A media company is now any company that helps pass information across the globe, including social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
